I am a <b>Computational Genomics Specialist</b> with a strong foundation in `bioinformatics` and `deep Learning`, earned through an M.S. in Bio and Brain Engineering from KAIST and a B.S. in Computer Science and Life Science from Handong Global University, where I graduated summa cum laude. Currently, I am part of the Pipeline Development team at <a href='https://inocras.com/' target="_blank">Inocras</a>, focusing on developing and refining advanced computational pipelines for both somatic and germline genomic analysis.

My research background includes <b>developing computational methods to combat drug resistance in cancer</b> using `generative adversarial networks (GANs)` and `graph neural networks (GNNs)` ([link to my paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38034356/)). I have worked extensively with various multi-omics datasets, clinical data, and electronic health records (EHR), utilizing statistical methods and machine learning to address complex challenges in various diseases. My hands-on laboratory experience, combined with technical proficiency in Python, R, Java, and C++, equips me to contribute to advancements in human health.

My primary interest lies in developing `advanced computational tools`, including those using machine learning, and integrating extensive `omics` datasets to capture cancer's complexity, ultimately aiming to decipher cancer mechanisms for more effective treatments. I strive to make significant contributions through innovative research and technology development. Recognized with top honors in Life Science and multiple academic excellence scholarships, I am fluent in both Korean and English and excel in collaborative, interdisciplinary environments.
