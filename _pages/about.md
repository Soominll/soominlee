I am a <b>Bioinformatics Scientist</b> with a strong foundation in `multiomics` and `deep learning`. Currently, I am part of the Pipeline Development team at <a href='https://inocras.com/' target="_blank">Inocras</a>, focusing on developing and refining advanced computational pipelines for both somatic and germline genomic analysis.

I earned an M.S. in Bio and Brain Engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and a B.S. in Computer Science and Life Science from Handong Global University (HGU), where I graduated summa cum laude. 

My research background includes <b>developing computational methods to combat drug resistance in cancer</b> using `generative adversarial networks (GANs)` and `graph neural networks (GNNs)` ([link to my paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38034356/)). I have worked extensively with various multi-omics datasets, clinical data, and electronic health records (EHR), utilizing statistical methods and machine learning to address complex challenges in various diseases. My hands-on laboratory experience, combined with technical proficiency in Python, R, Java, and C++, equips me to contribute to advancements in human health.

My primary interest lies in
  1. Developing `advanced computational tools`, including those using machine learning
  2. Integrating extensive `omics` datasets to capture disease's complexity
  3. Deciphering mechanisms of complex diseases to advance `personalized medicine` and more effective treatments. 

I strive to make significant contributions through innovative research and technology development. Recognized with top honors in Life Science and multiple academic excellence scholarships, I am fluent in both Korean and English and excel in collaborative, interdisciplinary environments.
