This has led to more accurate variant identification and a reduction in SV calls by up to 78%. I also develop algorithms for actionable findings by integrating, refining, and optimizing data from `The Clinical Knowledgebase (CKB)` into our somatic pipeline to provide precise data for actionable drugs, on-label drug recommendations, and clinical trial matching. Additionally, I contribute to an AI-driven project developing `deep learning-based mutation callers` to enhance mutation detection accuracy and efficiency.",
